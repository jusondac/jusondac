# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Rejka Permana** A.K.A **Jusondac**. I'm Software Engineer Ruby from 2019. Currently, I'm in College as a student. 
I build my own tools for Analyzing. For some reason, I'm not published, its private purpose, but for a bit tools I share it here on my github. Active on CTF, some writeups might be uploaded here soon as event ended
I use Ruby as my Lang Signature or Daily Driver. Currently I'm learning **Metaprogramming** by **Paolo Perrota** for references.
