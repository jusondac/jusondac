I'm Rejka Permana, a.k.a. Jusondac â€” a Software Engineer with a love for Ruby and Bash. Iâ€™ve been building with Ruby since 2019, and currently Iâ€™m diving deep into Bash scripting to automate and enhance development workflows.

Most of my projects are personal or private, but I occasionally share tools or experiments here â€” especially ones I find useful. Iâ€™m also active in CTF challenges, and may upload some writeups after events conclude.

- ðŸ›  I use Ruby as my main language and Bash as my go-to for scripting.
- ðŸ“š Currently studying Metaprogramming with help from Paolo Perrottaâ€™s book.
- ðŸ”§ Expect tools, scripts, and experiments â€” not just polished apps.
