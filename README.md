# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Rejka Permana** A.K.A **Jusondac**. I'm Software Engineer Ruby for the last 3 years. Currently, I'm in College as a student. 
I build my own tools for Analyzing. For some reason, I'm not published, its private purpose, but for a bit tools I share it here on my github.
I use Ruby as my Lang Signature or Daily Driver. Currently I'm learning **Metaprogramming** by **Paolo Perrota** for references.
